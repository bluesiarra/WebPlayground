### What I learned

The main thing I focused on was flexboxes and how to use them. I learned how flex displays work, and how they can be used. In my case, I turned the body into one huge flex container and centered the div with all of the contact information on it. I also used the flexbox in order to center all the buttons, text, image, etc. on the center of the div.



### Continued development

I'll probably personalize this page more and make it a little more interactive, since it's pretty dull and boring right now.

### Useful resources

- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-introduction-to-flexbox) - Definitely very helpful resource for learning how flexboxes work.
